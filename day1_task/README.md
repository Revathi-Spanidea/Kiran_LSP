In this program we are trying to change the permissions for a module.

Firstly, we are creating a file named examfile.txt usng "open()" system call.
We also error check while creatiing the file.
we created the file with write only permission.

Then we are trying to close the file along with error checking to do so.
Since we have the already created file, we now try to change the permissions using chmod() system call.
we error check here as well while changing the permissions.

Finally upon changing the permissions we print the message.
